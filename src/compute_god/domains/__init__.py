"""Domain-specific universes and playful simulations for Compute-God.

The :mod:`compute_god.domains` package now houses the eclectic collection of
scenario modules that previously lived at the root of the project.  Grouping
these modules under a dedicated namespace keeps the public API discoverable
while preserving the existing import paths through the compatibility shim in
:mod:`compute_god.__init__`.
