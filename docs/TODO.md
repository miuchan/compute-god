# Earth Online Experience Lab Â· TODO

A living checklist derived from the architecture blueprint in [README.md](../README.md).  Items marked as done are already implemented across the Python runtime and mirrored runtimes; unchecked tasks are open for contribution.

## âœ… Completed
- [x] Centralise the guidance desk blueprint inside `compute_god.catalogue` and share it with documentation/CLI consumers.
- [x] Refresh the top-level README with an interoperability-first project overview and repository layout guide.

## ðŸš§ In Progress
- [ ] Document the TypeScript runtime parity layer and note any API gaps compared to the Python engine.
- [ ] Add narrative-driven tutorials that walk through building a custom universe from blueprint to observer wiring.
- [ ] Automate catalogue snapshot generation for the documentation vault (HTML/Markdown) using `compute-god stations --format json`.

## ðŸ§­ Exploration Backlog
- [ ] Establish cross-repository integration tests that import the shared catalogue in downstream projects.
- [ ] Expand observer tooling with real-time telemetry streaming hooks for live workshops.
- [ ] Curate a "universe starter kit" template so new contributors can scaffold modules with consistent metrics and `run_*` helpers.
